    "For this independent study, Articles 1200, 1306, 1318, 1319, and 1320 were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the general rule is written in a positive tone followed by an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are times that the statute itself is written in a negative tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article usually contains a general rule, qualifiers, and several exceptions. Keywords such as 'except', 'with the exception that' and 'unless' signposts an exception while words like 'additionally' and 'provided' signposts a qualifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some statutes are also written in several paragraphs. They may be in the form of enumeration of requisites like in Art. 1318, or they could pertain to different yet related topics like in Art. 1319.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Article 1200. The right of choice belongs to the debtor, unless it has been expressly granted to the creditor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser should be able to identify the general rule from the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Article 1306. The contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient, provided they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy. (1255a)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser should be able to identify the qualifying conditions in order for the statute to apply. The word \"provided\" may be used as a qualifier or an exception depending on its usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Article 1318. There is no contract unless the following requisites concur:\n",
    "\n",
    "#####    (1) Consent of the contracting parties;\n",
    "\n",
    "#####    (2) Object certain which is the subject matter of the contract;\n",
    "\n",
    "#####    (3) Cause of the obligation which is established. (1261)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser should be able to recognize the enumerated phrases as part of the article. However, this is an example of a statute made in a negative tone. The outcome may become erroneous such that it would accept \"there is no contract\" as a general rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Article 1319. Consent is manifested by the meeting of the offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to constitute the contract. The offer must be certain and the acceptance absolute. A qualified acceptance constitutes a counter-offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acceptance made by letter or telegram does not bind the offerer except from the time it came to his knowledge. The contract, in such a case, is presumed to have been entered into in the place where the offer was made. (1262a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a statute that has numerous subjects. In this example, Consent and Acceptance were discussed in two paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Article 1320. An acceptance may be express or implied. (n)\n",
