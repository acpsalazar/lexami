# Iurius Amicus

Literally, your "legal friend"


## Mission

Currently, I am building the knowledge base for jurisprudence, laws, and statutes. I am trying to find out ways to accurately predict the nature of the case by leveraging on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.


## Vision

To create a chatbot that will interact with indigents with their legal concerns. It is not a substitute for a competent legal counsel but could aid in legal research.


## TODO: Significance of the Study

Most of the time the impoverished are not aware that they have an actionable case at all. While the Public Attorneys' Office (PAO) is there to address their concerns, some of them are hesitant to come forward because they find the process bureaucratic. To lay emphasis on the tool not being a replacement of a proper legal counsel, the chatbot feature could help in gathering facts and details of their legal concerns.
