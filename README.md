## Significance of the Study

Justice delayed is justice denied. One of the reasons why the impoverished are afraid to seek legal remedy is the notion that litigation is expensive and the procedure can be bureaucratic. As an alternative, they seek the help of public affairs shows which is not the right avenue to air concerns and to protect individual rights and privacy. The chatbot aims to help legal researchers by gathering the narrative of the client's complaint, and by utilizing a ranking algorithm with the legal knowledgebase, it generates a report recommending relevant jurisprudence, statutes, and other legal bases.
